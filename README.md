# Background
Mazes have been a popular form of entertainment and mental challenge for centuries. One way to construct a maze is by starting with an n√ón grid and removing walls to create a path from a start to a finish. In this project, we will use a different method of constructing mazes by assigning random values to walls and finding a minimum spanning tree of a graph constructed from the dual of the maze grid. The goal of this project is to write a program that uses the algorithm described above to generate mazes and solve them. The program will generate a maze of its own and ideally visualize the solution. The program will be written in a modern programming language such as JAVA and will make use of data structures and algorithms to efficiently generate and solve mazes.

# Description
This project aims to create a program that can generate and solve mazes using a unique algorithm. Instead of starting with an empty grid and removing walls to create a path from a start to a finish, we will assign random values to walls and construct a graph from the dual of the maze grid. We will then find a minimum spanning tree of the graph and remove walls corresponding to the edges in the tree, resulting in a maze that can be solved using a graph traversal algorithm.
